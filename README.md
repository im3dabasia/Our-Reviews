# Our Reviews Section 

## ReactJs  [Live Demo](https://beautiful-chimera-010c8d.netlify.app/)


I have created a UI whereby data such as messages, profile pictures of several users in dynamically displayed in a log.

![Alt Text]()


Features:
Used useStates in flushing in data in the centre of the the page
Conditional rendering was even used in loading the page initially when the data is bieng fetched 
used CSS visibility feature to play around with the left and the right reviews
Added CSS transitions translateX and translateY to make it more naturall and not sudden
