# Our Reviews Section 

## ReactJs  [Live Demo](https://beautiful-chimera-010c8d.netlify.app/)


So the reviews section is common in almost every webapp one visits today, say like ecommerce sites, dating sites, blogs and discussion forums etc So here in this app/ a portion of the app i understood how does the cool looking review section internally work. I realised the importance of data structures like array and queues. Also got to understand the power of some special CSS properties like visibility and display.

Features:
* Used useStates in flushing in data in the centre of the the page
* Conditional rendering was even used in loading the page initially when the data is bieng fetched 
* Used CSS visibility feature to play around with the left and the right reviews
* Added CSS transitions translateX and translateY to make it more naturall and not sudden
